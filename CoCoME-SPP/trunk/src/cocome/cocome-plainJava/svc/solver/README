This folder should contain the AMPL/CPLEX solver developed by AMPL
Optimization LLC (www.ampl.com). The solver is used to determine the optimal
amounts and locations of stock items to transfer between stores when a store
runs low on particular stock item.

The student edition of the AMPL software can be downloaded from the AMPL web
site, provided you use the software for educational/non-commercial purposes.

Along with AMPL, you will also need the CPLEX solver, which can be obtained
either from IBM through their Academic Initiative programme, or as a student
edition from AMPL website. Futher download details can be found at
